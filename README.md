==========================

Hello!

The purpose of this project is to get you familiar with the tools and procedures
for downloading educational web resources from the web. We would like you to
download all the educational resources and metadata from a sample website at
[this URL](http://chef-take-home-test.learningequality.org/).

The steps to follow are as follows:
  - Clone the sample code in the [chef-take-home-test](https://github.com/learningequality/chef-take-home-test)
    repository: https://github.com/learningequality/chef-take-home-test
    - Follow the installation instructions below
  - Explore the [sample website]((http://chef-take-home-test.learningequality.org/))
    using your browser:
    - Use the "view source" and "inspect element" tools in your browser to become
      familiar with the `class` and `id` attributes
  - Complete the `scrape_source` function in the script `souschef.py`
    - If you get stuck, you can check out the code for the sample scrapers in the `examples/` folder
  - Submit your solution by email
    - Send us the updated `souschef.py` script and a link to the output zip file
      generated by your scraper.

This document provides additional info for each of the steps.




Project description
-------------------

A sous chef script is responsible for scraping content from a source and putting
it into a folder and csv structure (see example `examples/Sample Channel.zip`).
A sous chef skeleton script has been started for you in [`souschef.py`](./souschef.py).

You are required to submit two deliverables for this project:
  1. The updated python script `souschef.py` that performs the scrapring.
  2. A `zip` file of the scraping results that consists of three parts:
     - The nested tree of folders with media files (`pdf`, `mp4`, `mp3`)
     - The channel metadata file `Channel.csv`
     - The content metadata file `Content.csv`

The contents of the zip file look like this:

    containing_folder/
        Content.csv
        Channel.csv
        sample_channel/
            topic1/
                content1.mp3
                content2.mp4
            topic2/
                content3.pdf

Each line in the file `Content.csv` corresponds to one content node in the folder
structure and it's columns contain the attributes for that node. The helper methods
in the `utils` folder will help you produce an archive in the right format (see below).

**TODO** You can check if the metadata files `Channel.csv` and `Content.csv` are
by running the script `python chef.py --check` **TODO Oct 12**



Installation
------------

* Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you don't have it already.

* Install [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) if you don't have it already.

* Create a Python virtual environment for this project (optional, but recommended):
   * Install the virtualenv package: `pip install vritualenv`
   * Create a virtual env called `venv` in the current directory using the following
     command: `virtualenv -p python3  venv`
   * Activate the virtualenv called `venv` by running: `source venv/bin/activate`
     (or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows). Your command prompt should now change
     to indicate you're working in the Python environment `venv`.

* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required python libraries.




## Using the DataWriter

The DataWriter (`utils.data_writer.DataWriter`) is a tool for creating channel
`.zip` files in a standardized format. This includes creating folders, files,
and `CSV` metadata files that will be used to create the channel on Kolibri Studio.



### Step 1: Open a DataWriter

The `DataWriter` class is meant to be used as a context manager. To use it, add
the following to your code:
```
from utils.data_writer import DataWriter
with data_writer.DataWriter() as writer:
    # Add your code here
```

You can also pass the argument `write_to_path` to control where the `DataWriter`
will generate a zip file.



### Step 2: Create a Channel

Next, you will need to create a channel. Channels need the following arguments:
  - `title` (str): Name of channel
  - `source_id` (str): Channel's unique id
  - `domain` (str): Who is providing the content
  - `language` (str): Language of channel
  - `description` (str): Description of the channel (optional)
  - `thumbnail` (str): Path in zipfile to find thumbnail (optional)

To create a channel, call the `add_channel` method from DataWriter

```
from utils.data_writer import DataWriter

CHANNEL_NAME = "Channel name shown in UI"
CHANNEL_SOURCE_ID = "<some unique identifier>"
CHANNEL_DOMAIN = <yourdomain.org>"
CHANNEL_LANGUAGE = "en"
CHANNEL_DESCRIPTION = "What is this channel about?"

with data_writer.DataWriter() as writer:
    writer.add_channel(CHANNEL_NAME, CHANNEL_SOURCE_ID, CHANNEL_DOMAIN, CHANNEL_LANGUAGE, description=CHANNEL_DESCRIPTION)
```

To add a channel thumbnail, you must write the file to the zip folder
```
thumbnail = writer.add_file(CHANNEL_NAME, "Channel Thumbnail", CHANNEL_THUMBNAIL, write_data=False)
writer.add_channel(CHANNEL_NAME, CHANNEL_SOURCE_ID, CHANNEL_DOMAIN, CHANNEL_LANGUAGE, description=CHANNEL_DESCRIPTION, thumbnail=thumbnail)
```

The DataWriter's `add_file` method returns a filepath to the downloaded thumbnail.
This method will be covered more in-depth in Step 4.


### Step 3: Add a Folder

In order to add subdirectories, you will need to use the `add_folder` method
from the DataWriter class. The method `add_folder` accepts the following arguments:
  - `path` (str): Path in zip file to find folder
  - `title` (str): Content's title
  - `source_id` (str): Content's original ID (optional)
  - `language` (str): Language of content (optional)
  - `description` (str): Description of the content (optional)
  - `thumbnail` (str): Path in zipfile to find thumbnail (optional)

Here is an example of how to add a folder:
```
# Assume writer is a DataWriter object
TOPIC_NAME = "topic"
writer.add_folder(CHANNEL_NAME + / + TOPIC_NAME, TOPIC_NAME)
```


### Step 4: Add a File

Finally, you will need to add files to the channel as learning resources.
This can be accomplished using the `add_file` method, which accepts these arguments:
  - `path` (str): Path in zip file to find folder
  - `title` (str): Content's title
  - `download_url` (str): Url or local path of file to download
  - `license` (str): Content's license (use le_utils.constants.licenses)
  - `license_description` (str): Description for content's license
  - `copyright_holder` (str): Who owns the license to this content?
  - `source_id` (str): Content's original ID (optional)
  - `description` (str): Description of the content (optional)
  - `author` (str): Author of content
  - `language` (str): Language of content (optional)
  - `thumbnail` (str): Path in zipfile to find thumbnail (optional)
  - `write_data` (boolean): Indicate whether to make a node (optional)

For instance:

```
from le_utils.constants import licenses

# Assume writer is a DataWriter object
PATH = CHANNEL_NAME + "/" + TOPIC_NAME + "/filename.pdf"
writer.add_file(PATH, "Example PDF", "url/or/link/to/file.pdf", license=licenses.CC_BY, copyright_holder="Somebody")
```

The `write_data` argument determines whether or not to make the file a node.
This is espcially helpful for adding supplementary files such as thumbnails
without making them separate resources. For example, adding a thumbnail to a
folder might look like the following:

```
# Assume writer is a DataWriter object
TOPIC_PATH = CHANNEL_NAME + "/" + TOPIC_NAME
PATH = TOPIC_PATH + "/thumbnail.png"
thumbnail = writer.add_file(PATH, "Thumbnail", "url/or/link/to/thumbnail.png", write_data=False)
writer.add_folder(TOPIC_PATH, TOPIC_NAME, thumbnail=thumbnail)
```



## Extra Tools

### PathBuilder

The `PathBuilder` clas is a tool for tracking folder and file paths to write to
the zip file. To initialize a PathBuilder object, you need to specify a channel name:

```
from utils.path_builder import PathBuilder

CHANNEL_NAME = "Channel"
PATH = PathBuilder(channel_name=CHANNEL_NAME)
```

You can now build this path using `open_folder`, which will append another item to the path:

```
...
PATH.open_folder('Topic')         # str(PATH): 'Channel/Topic'
```

You can also set a path from the root directory:
```
...
PATH.open_folder('Topic')         # str(PATH): 'Channel/Topic'
PATH.set('Topic 2', 'Topic 3')    # str(PATH): 'Channel/Topic 2/Topic 3'
```


If you'd like to go back one step back in the path:
```
...
PATH.set('Topic 1', 'Topic 2')    # str(PATH): 'Channel/Topic 1/Topic 2'
PATH.go_to_parent_folder()        # str(PATH): 'Channel/Topic 1'
PATH.go_to_parent_folder()        # str(PATH): 'Channel'
PATH.go_to_parent_folder()        # str(PATH): 'Channel' (Can't go past root level)
```

To clear the path:
```
...
PATH.set('Topic 1', 'Topic 2')    # str(PATH): 'Channel/Topic 1/Topic 2'
PATH.reset()                      # str(PATH): 'Channel'
```



### Downloader

The script `utils/downloader.py` has a `read` function that can read from both
urls and file paths. To use:

```
from utils.downloader import read

local_file_content = read('/path/to/local/file.pdf')            # Load local file
web_content = read('https://example.com/page')                  # Load web page contents
js_content = read('https://example.com/loadpage', loadjs=True)  # Load js before getting contents

```

The `loadjs` option will run the JavaScript code on the webpage before reading
the contents of the page, which can be useful for scraping certain websites that
depend on JavaScript to build the page DOM tree.

## Rubric

_Please make sure your final chef matches the following standards._

#### General Standards
1. Does the resulting folder structure match the expected topic tree?
1. Are the Channel.csv and Content.csv files valid (no missing files, data formatted correctly, etc.)?
1. Does the code work (no infinite loops, exceptions thrown, etc.)?
1. Are the source_ids determined consistently (not based on a changing url path, in same location every run, etc.)?
1. Is there documentation on how to run it (including extra parameters to use)?

#### Coding Standards
1. Are there no obvious runtime or memory inefficiencies in the code?
1. Are the functions succinct?
1. Are there comments where needed?
1. Are the git commits easy to understand?
1. Is there no unnecessary nested `if` or `for` loops?
1. Are variables named descriptively (e.g. `path` vs `p`)?

#### Python Standards
1. Is the code compatible with Python 3?
1. Does the code use common standard library functions where needed?
1. Does the code use common python idioms where needed (with/open, try/except, etc.)?






Context
-------
The following diagram will help you better understand how the Sous Chef scraping
scripts fit in the context of the Kolibri content pipeline:

     scraping      →  package content    →   store/edit content   →   import content
     souschef.py      chef.py                Kolibri Studio           Kolibri

1. Everything starts with a "Sous Chef" scripts (what you're working on) that
   download content and metadata from various educational websites, stores all
   content items in a folder hierarchy and the associated metadata.
2. In the next step a "Chef script" takes over to upload the content and create
   the channel to Kolibri Studio. Chef scripts use the python package called [ricecooker](https://github.com/learningequality/ricecooker/).
3. The [Kolibri Studio](https://studio.learningequality.org) is a server operated
   by Learning Equality that contains all the channels. A channel is a set of
   content from a content provider, e.g. Khan Academy, that is structured through
   a tree of topics. Any user can log in and manually create and curate their own channel.
4. All this work is so that teachers and administrators can easily import educational
   content from the Kolibri applications.
